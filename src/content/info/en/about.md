We are a semi-professional Minecraft Java server development studio, founded by **Katto**, **FranNazurRM** and **Sir_Reviaj** on August 10, 2023.

We mainly work on the side of mods with the help of plugins, always trying to innovate with these resources without losing quality. Additionally, we are distributors of useful mods and plugins for the creation of events or series through [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/organization/bangamestudios).

Our main founder, **Katto**, had been creating servers for years before the establishment of the studio, some few public, but in general to play with friends. Normally, he developed them together with **FranNazurRM** and **Sir_Reviaj**.

When they reached a project that was going to be so big that they decided to make it more public, creating a studio initially fictitious to promote that project, which would later be published in episodes in YouTube by the participants (friends).

The studio scaled to such an extent that they decided to change their idea and make the project public, to which access would be through a form. Also, they started to take the studio more seriously.

Over time, we have reached to collaborate and affiliate with [Crysis Studios](https://crysistudio.xyz), almost affiliate with [Infected MC](https://sites.google.com/view/creeperx365/infected-mc?authuser=0) and, currently, we are affiliates with [Minemu](https://minemu.es), which provides us hosting services (server).
